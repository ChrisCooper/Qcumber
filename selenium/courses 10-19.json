At the same time debates continue about the interaction between Canada`s international human rights obligations, rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and domestic statutory human rights. As well, new emerging grounds of discrimination are being considered here and in the United States, some of which challenge our understanding of both \"discrimination\" and \"equality\". This course will examine the nature and extent of domestic human rights protection with reference to the more than thirty international instruments relating to human rights that have been ratified by Canada. This examination will be undertaken with reference to the full range of human rights as envisaged in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed in the Vienna Declaration. The legal structure of Canadian human rights protection, its scope and its deficiencies, will be considered at the Constitutional and at the Federal and Provincial statutory levels. In this course, we will consider topics including the following: the evolution of human rights law in Canada and Ontario; the relation between the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Canada's international human rights commitments and statutory human rights protection; the meaning of discrimination and equality; the domestic justiciability of human rights; existing and emerging categories of human rights protection; conflicts between rights; and access to international human rights adjudication.", "s": 81, "sec": [{"ty": 2, "c": [{"i": "McHenry,Kirsti Margaret", "ed": "2011/12/02", "r": "MACDONALD RM400", "ts": 37, "sd": "2011/09/06"}], "te": 1, "id": "1200", "in": "001"}], "t": "Human Rights", "n": "522"}, {"d": "", "s": 149, "sec": [], "t": "Biblical Themes/Restor.Justice", "n": "629"}, {"d": "A comparative examination of the politics and government of different countries, theories or themes in comparative politics.

The course starts with an overall view of the dynamics associated with different parts of the plant, i.e. reactor, heat transport systems, moderator, steam generator, turbine, and electrical generator. Based on such knowledge, the control and regulation functions in the above systems are then defined. Different instrumentation and measurement techniques are examined, along with control strategies. The time and frequency domain performance characterizations of control loops are introduced with consideration of actuator and sensor limitations. Different controller design and tuning methods and instrumentation calibration procedures are discussed. Two modes of operation of CANDU plants will be analyzed, i.e. normal mode and alternate mode. Advanced control technologies, such as distributed control systems, Field bus communication protocols are introduced in view of their potential applications in the existing and newly constructed CANDU power plants. The electric systems in the CANDU plant will be examined. The modeling of the dynamics and control devices for the generator will be covered in details. The dynamic interaction between the CANDU power plants and the rest of the electric power grid with other generating facilities and various types of load will be studied.

The first focuses on the developing jurisprudence and practical implementation of international criminal law. Since 1993 there has been a renewed interest in prosecuting persons who have committed crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide with the establishment of international tribunals and mixed international/domestic tribunals. These Tribunals prosecute persons who allegedly committed such crimes during wars in the Former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia and Indonesia. The focus will be on the development of the law applicable to individual criminal responsibility, international crimes, principles applicable in armed conflict, and command responsibility. The primary source will be the law and practice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, but also that of the Rwanda Tribunal, Sierra Leone Tribunal and the International Criminal Court. The second aspect of the course explores international aspects of Canadian criminal law, specifically extradition and Canada\u00bfs cooperation internationally in relation to criminal matters. The extradition component of the course will explore the purpose of extradition, and how Canada gives effect to it, including  process and procedures.

Examples of social innovations include The Grameen Bank, a non-traditional bank that makes micro-loans to poor populations around the globe. It was funded in Bangladesh by Mohammad Yunnus, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. Another example is Kiva.org, a web-based system that directly connects small entrepreneurs in emerging countries to lenders anywhere on the globe, who can make an interest-free loan of as little as $25 to the project and entrepreneur of their choice. There are many social innovations around us, some of which have already changed the lives of many, providing better access to credit, health services, or community-building. Many more social innovations yet remain to be invented and scaled up. Course objectives:  After taking this course, students should be able to:1) Understand the basic concepts of systems thinking and social innovation; 2) apply those concepts to compare various social innovation projects; 3)design, implement and evaluate a social innovation initiative. We will spend a lot of time in this class discussing real social innovations and the current challenges that they face. During class discussion and assignments you will experiment with various ways to describe complex social systems, analyze them, prescribe interventions, and discuss implementation issues.You will also have a chance to interview social entrepreneurs and assess their project.

Approximately eighty students work on clients' files during the academic year. Up to twelve students are hired to take responsibility for the files from May through August. In the academic year following their summer employment, these students take on mentoring and administrative responsibilities and are eligible for academic credits as student leaders of Queen's Legal Aid. Second year students can obtain credits by registering in LAW-591. Third year students can obtain credits by registering in LAW-592. These credits are optional. They can either be allocated to one term or divided between two terms. They can also be accumulated during both second and third year law.

Moreover, its rulings have an increasingly deep and important impact on not only trade relations between the sovereign Members of the WTO, but also their regulation of many aspects of their domestic affairs. This course seeks to demystify the WTO DSM. We will examine its structure and identify its strengths and weaknesses through a practical walk-through of all the stages of dispute settlement in concrete cases. Specifically, we will explore identification of trade barriers by a state, the decision to engage WTO dispute settlement, Consultations, panel request, the panel process, the appellate process, arbitration and, finally, implementation. We will do so against the background of the systemic and theoretical considerations that underlie the functioning of the WTO DSM.

Capabilities now exist to synthesize materials with grains where one or more dimension is on the nanoscale (less than 100 nm). As the grain size decreases, there is a significant increase in the volume fraction of grain boundaries or interfaces. This characteristic strongly influences the chemical and physical properties of the materials. For example, nanostructured ceramics are tougher and stronger than coarser grained ceramics, while nanostructured metals exhibit increases in yield strength and elastic modulus. It has also been shown that other properties (e.g. electrical, optical and magnetic) are influenced by a fine grain structure. The goal of this course is to introduce the student to the impact of length scale, from millimeter to nanometer, on material properties, with a primary but not exclusive focus on mechanical properties.

But current national reforms in mathematics education are recommending that middle school teachers think in new ways about the content of their instruction (what to teach) and pedagogy (how to teach). This course is intended to launch you as a learner and teacher of mathematics in ways that correlate with new directions in mathematics curriculum. The purpose of this course is to help you learn to think of the mathematics you will teach from the perspective of the student who is learning. You will have the opportunity to explore the teaching of mathematics through investigating how students learn mathematics in the areas of whole numbers, rational numbers, measurement, geometry, probability, and algebra.

For example, we might ask: Who benefits from global governance? Whose values are being promoted, and why? Who is to be governed, and why? What roles have (neoliberal) states and markets played in the construction and reproduction of global governance? Which interests and \u00bfspaces\u00bf are excluded, and why? How are we to make sense of global governance in the larger, multi-disciplinary frame of global political economy? And, finally, how are we to understand the relevance of global governance with regard to North-South relations and wider questions of development? This course examines these questions analytically by exploring concrete and pertinent features of the global political economy, including the role played by states in facilitating the growing power of corporations, which in turn shape the wider development agenda. \nPrerequisite: MA standing in Global Development Studies, or permission of the Department.      \nExclusion: DEVS-496*", "s": 36, "sec": [{"ty": 2, "c": [{"i": "Soederberg,Susanne M", "ed": "2011/12/02", "r": "MACINTOSH-CORRY RM E202", "ts": 132, "sd": "2011/09/12"}], "te": 1, "id": "11759", "in": "001"}], "t": "Topics in Development Studies 4", "n": "806"}, {"d": "Offered jointly with DEVS-492* with additional work required.Three term-hours; Winter.

Students will critically engage with feminist perspectives pertaining to the public and private meanings associated with reproduction and examine how these meanings are contingent on assumptions about gender, sex, class, race, sexuality, culture, physical (dis)ability, marital status, IQ and historical location. We will address such questions as: Is sexual difference necessarily determined by sexual reproduction?  How have maternal bodies been positioned in culture; differentiated; represented; valued as appropriate or inappropriate; constituted in relation to the bodies of fetuses, children, women who are not mothers? What is the relationship between the state and reproduction? How has medicine and science impacted reproductive choices and for whose benefit? How have population policies and globalization shaped reproductive politics? Does genetic engineering hold the promise of reproductive freedom?

For the steps within the fuel cycles, the method of determining the associated costs, in particular those relevant to the disposal of nuclear waste, and the overall fuel cycle costs are described. Burn-up calculations are performed for the swelling time of the fuel within the reactor core. The objectives and merits of in-core and out-of-core fuel management for CANDU Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) and Light Water Reactors (LWR) are analyzed in detail, for the refueling equilibrium as well as for the approach to refueling equilibrium. The course also covers fuel management for thorium-fuelled CANDU reactors and other advanced fuels such as MOX containing plutonium from discarded nuclear warheads, and DUPIC (Direct Use of PWR fuel in CANDU reactors). The fuel management problem is treated as an optimization problem, with objective functions or performance indexes identified, as well as decision variables and appropriate constraints (active and non-active).

Students will learn how the common law regulation of unfair competition (the tort of passing off) complements the statutory protections afforded for brands and logos that now dominate modern consumer culture. Some attention is given to theoretical justifications and normative frameworks for trade-mark protection; public policy objectives; the basis for making a trademark application and grounds for opposition, distinctiveness and use; infringement; title; the relationship to the law of trade-names under common law and federal and provincial incorporation statutes; and international obligations to which Canadian law must conform, notably through the Paris Convention and Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement.

In other respects, Canada is a leading jurisdiction, in particular in its definition of the family. We have much to learn from each other.

It therefore creates an exciting opportunity for students to engage in analytical creativity and innovation.The central constitutional question the course explores is whether, and to what extent, the State has social and economic obligations to its citizen. Problems in this area of the law appear in many forms and contexts. The obvious context is welfare and healthcare, where courts are asked to rule on matters such as reimbursing a patient for an expensive organ transplant abroad, increasing welfare sums, or building low cost housing. But the problem also emerges in matters which initially seem to be pure economic policy. For example, in the past few years, many workers have lost their pensions once their employers went bankrupt because current bankruptcy legislation does not protect their interests in such circumstances. However, if the Charter provides for a right to basic security at old age, the state might have an obligation to change the legislation so that the pension plans of retiring employees enjoy a higher priority than other creditors.1 credit, fall termProfessor Kahana", "s": 81, "sec": [], "t": "Soc & Econ Rights In Canada", "n": "632"}, {"d": "", "s": 30, "sec": [], "t": "Photography (B)", "n": "415"}, {"d": "This course provides a foundation in the study of speech sounds.
